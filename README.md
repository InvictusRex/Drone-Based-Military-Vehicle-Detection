# Drone-Based Real-Time Military Vehicle Detection Using YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 Architectures

This project presents an advanced object detection system for **real-time identification of military vehicles** from UAV-mounted cameras using YOLO-based deep learning models. We benchmark six model variants, YOLOv8n, v8s, v8m and YOLOv11n, 11s, 11m, to determine the optimal choice for **onboard drone deployment**, balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency.

The models are evaluated on a curated multi-class aerial dataset featuring tanks, trucks, humvees, and armored vehicles, with an input resolution of 1024√ó1024 across all variants.

## ‚úÖ Model Selection for Drone Deployment

The choice of model depends on the deployment scenario:

### üîπ **Best Overall Detection Performance**
- **Model**: `YOLOv8m`
- **Why**: Highest mAP@50 (0.777), F1 (0.766), and accuracy (0.767)
- **Trade-off**: High computational load (78.7 GFLOPs); suitable for high-end edge GPUs (Jetson AGX Xavier, Orin)

### üîπ **Best Lightweight Deployment**
- **Model**: `YOLOv11n`
- **Why**: Lowest GFLOPs (6.3), good balance of precision (0.758) and mAP@50 (0.744)
- **Use-case**: UAVs with strict power constraints (e.g., Jetson Nano, RPi + Coral)

### üîπ **Balanced Performance and Efficiency**
- **Model**: `YOLOv8s` or `YOLOv11s`
- **Why**: Reasonable accuracy (F1 ~0.75), moderate GFLOPs (~20‚Äì28), low memory footprint
- **Use-case**: Mid-range edge devices; real-time inference with acceptable latency

## üî¨ Research Insights

- **YOLOv8m** is optimal when accuracy is paramount and compute is available.
- **YOLOv11n** and **YOLOv11s** are strong contenders for energy-efficient UAVs.
- Detection performance is consistent across architectures, but compute constraints significantly influence deployment feasibility.

## üöß Known Limitations

- Models show reduced performance under:
  - Occlusion
  - Similar background clutter
  - Low-light aerial imagery
- Dataset may lack diversity in angles and backgrounds for some classes (e.g., trucks)

## üõ† Future Work

- Add thermal and night-vision variants to improve detection in low visibility
- Integrate tracking (e.g., DeepSORT) for target persistence
- Deploy real-world test flights using NVIDIA Jetson boards
- Quantize and prune selected models for faster inference and reduced power draw
